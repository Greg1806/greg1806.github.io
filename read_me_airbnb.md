# Airbnb users 1st booking destination prediction - Kaggle

## Context
New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.

## Objectives
**Primary:** Predict in which country new US Airbnb users will make their 1st booking based on their demographics, web session records and some summary statistics.

## Content
* **Important Data preparation required to feed model with good features**
  * EDA
  * Data cleaning
  * Feature engineering
  * One-hot-encoding for categorical variables
* **ML models**
  * DecisionTreeClassifier
  * LogisticRegression
  * RandomForestClassifier

**Overall relatively poor performance even with accuracy close to 70%. Models predicting Mostly NDF and US and almost never other destinations. Better feature engineering as well as hyperparameters tuning would help.
