# Image classifier for vehicules found on EPFL campus - Swissroads

## Objectives
Primary: Test different classifiers and techniques using high-level features extracted with a pretrained convolutional neural network from TensorFlow Hub and compare results with own ConvNet implementation trained fomr the raw image pixels
Secondary: Build an image classifier using Swissroads dataset which contains several hundreds images of vehicles found in the EPFL in Lausanne

## Content
* **Classifiers:**

  * Decisiont Tree
  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * SVMs
  * Keras
