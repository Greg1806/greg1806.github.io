# Credit Card Fraud detection (Anomaly detection - Imbalanced dataset) - Kaggle

## Context
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

## Objectives
**Primary:** Classify transactions as either spam or non-spam based on 30 input variables (28 of them have been created from a dimensionality reduction exercise)
<br> **Secondary:** Focus on trying to improve Logistic Regression model through several technics including Grid Search optimizing for F1 and AUPRC

## Content
* **EDA**
* **Logistic Regression**
  * GridSearchCV
  * Confusion Matrix
  * Classification Report
  * Precision-Recall curve and optimized threshold
