# Swiss public transport network delay predition (imbalanced dataset)
Capstone project for "Applied Data Science: Machine learning" course from EPFL in Lausanne

## Context
Switzerland public transports are known worldwide for their punctuality. I wanted to confirm this hypothesis that overall public transport are reliable while simulatenously assesing potential pockets of lower performance (e.g.: providers, stations or mean of transports with frequent and/or important delays)

## Objectives
**Primary:** predict delays for train connections in swiss transport network
<br> **Secondary:** assess transport network performance and identify regions/providers/lines with more frequent delays (part of EDA)

## Content
* **Project proposal including EDA:** "Capstone-proposal-GregoireLaurent-vFinal"
* **Data cleaning and engineering based on EDA:** "Capstone-project-GregoireLaurent-Datacleaning"
* **Comparion of ML models and final conclusion:** "Capstone-project-GregoireLaurent-MLtasks"
  * ML models including: Logistic Regression, SVMs, Trees and Keras
  * Performance assement based on F1 scores and Area under Precision-Recall curve
